# Project Working Steps

## After connecting template engines
1. first make sure that mongodb is connected
2. next step is we need to create database schema in model
   a. open usermodel
   b. design the db schema (which includes field names of table and data types)
   ex: user ->field names = data types
                name=string
               email = string
                mobile = string
                age = number
                (you can continue adding fields according to your requirement)
